# Collaboration Policy: You are encouraged to collaborate with up to 3 other
# students, but all work submitted must be your own independently written
# solution. List the computing ids of all of your collaborators in the
# comments at the top of each submitted file. Do not share written notes,
# documents (including Google docs, Overleaf docs, discussion notes, PDFs), or
# code. Do not seek published or online solutions, including pseudocode, for
# this assignment. If you use any published or online resources (which may not
# include solutions) when completing this assignment, be sure to cite them. Do
# not submit a solution that you are unable to explain orally to a member of
# the course staff. Any solutions that share similar text/code will be
# considered in breach of this policy. Please refer to the syllabus for a
# complete description of the collaboration policy.

    # This is the method that should set off the computation
    # of the supply chain problem.  It takes as input a list containing lines of input
    # as strings.  You should parse that input and then call a
    # subroutine that you write to compute the total edge-weight sum
    # and return that value from this method
    #
    # @return the total edge-weight sum of a tree that connects nodes as described
    # in the problem statement
